## /Sum/:
**Difference Engine** is a minimalistic diff data analyzer, specifically designed for generation of lightweight patching utils. Itâ€™s rather simple to put in use without any prior knowledge of binary alteration mechanics.  
Was never flagged by AVs so far.

##/Featurae/:
-	Fully native implementation with no external dependencies.
-	Extensive commandline automation support.
-	Rather minimalistic Win98-inspired GUI.
-	XCopy-based installation.

## /Reassembling/:
**Difference Engine** is written completely in *PureBasic v4.40*, though compatible with *5.2x (LTS)*.  
To rebuild project use 'Main.pb' as root sourcefile for main .exe and 'Template.pb' to compile 'Template.App.'
