## /Sum/:
**Difference Engine** is a minimalistic diff data analyzer, specifically designed for generation of lightweight patching utils. Itâ€™s rather simple to put in use without any prior knowledge of binary alteration mechanics. 
Was never flagged by AVs so far.

##/Featurae/:
-	Fully native implementation with no external dependencies.
-	Extensive commandline automation support.
-	Rather minimalistic Win98-inspired GUI.
-	XCopy-based installation.
